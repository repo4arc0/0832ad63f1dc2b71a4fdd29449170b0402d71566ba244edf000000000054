143
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,610

146
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:09,650
因为这是我们最后一次在一起

这无法改变
It doesn't change the fact

157
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:07,730
他们根本没能到达机场的事实
that they never made it to the airport,

158
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:12,150
或是我为了逃避悲伤所做的那些事  但是

Plus, 611 million dollars for my little therapeutic experiment.

00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:22,560
任何一个正常人都不会赞助这个项目
No one in their right mind would ever funded it.

161
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:26,410
提醒我一下  麻省理工的宗旨是什么

也是人类所遭遇的最严峻的

另外  你们大多数都破产了

169
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:50,080
或者说  你们之前是

从现在开始
Starting now.

176
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:17,590
{\an8}现在我要请出基金负责人  派珀·波茨

177
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,330
别怕犯错  放手做吧
Go break some eggs.

178
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:35,810
我简直  真是要窒息了

179
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,730
托尼  太慷慨了  那么多钱

拨款会有一部分给教职工吗
Will any portion of that grant be made available to faculty?

182
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:46,250
我知道  真没品  但听我说
I know, ew, gross, but hear me out.

我不知道波茨女士不来了

这

00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:01,180
没事  我马上回来
fine. I..I..I'll be right back.

192
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:02,900
我们等下再聊
We'll catch up later.

193
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:23,290
你为那些年轻人做的事真是不错
That was nice, what you did for those young people.

194
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,640
他们应得的
Oh, they deserve it.

195
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:28,140
也让我的良心好过些
Plus it helps ease my conscious.

196
00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:33,170
据说慷慨与内疚是有关联的
They say, there's a correlation between generosity and guilt.

197
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,800

你要上去吗
Are you going up?

201
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:54,160
我就想待在这里
I'm right where I want to be.

202
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:56,880
行了  别动
Okay, okay.

203
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:02,290
对不起  职业病
Sorry, it's an occupational hazard.

204
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:06,620
我在国务院工作  人力资源部
I work for the State department. Human resources.

205

我知道这很无聊

206
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:12,200
但这让我能养活我的儿子

207
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:16,520
我很为他的成长骄傲
I'm very proud of what he grew up to be.

208
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:20,290
他叫查理·斯宾塞
His name was Charlie Spencer.

209
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:24,840
你杀了他

00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,800
在索科威亚
In Sokovia.

211
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:32,540
当然  这对你来说毫不重要
Not that that matters in the least to you.

212
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:36,650
你以为你为我们而战
You think you fight for us?

213
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,530
其实你只是为自己
You just fight for yourself.

214
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:44,920
谁会为我儿子复仇  斯塔克
Who's going to avenge my son, Stark?

215
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:49,370
他死了  都怪你
He's dead. And I blame you.

216
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:01,470
上月  在尼日利亚拉各斯  11名瓦坎达公民
11 Wakandans were among those killed during a confrontation

217
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:03,790
在复仇者联盟与雇佣兵的冲突中

不幸遇难
in Lagos, Nigeria, last month.

220
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:07,720
这些通常与世隔绝的瓦坎达人

我国人民的鲜血洒在了外国领土上
Our people's blood is spilled on foreign soil.

225
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:18,140
不仅是因为犯罪行为
Not only because of the actions of criminals,

226
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:22,130
还因为阻止犯罪的人的冷漠
but by the indifference of those pledge to stop them.

227
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:27,730
牺牲无辜者取得的胜利  根本算不上胜利
Victory at the expense of the innocent, is no victory at all.

228
00:19:27,730 --> 00:19:29,610
瓦坎达国王接着...
The Wakanda King went on to...

229
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:31,630
他们不受国际法的限制
They are operating outside and above the international law.

230
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:35,980
如果我们不回应此类行为  就会变成这样
Because that's the reality, if we don't respond to acts like these.

231
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:38,460
旺达·马克西莫夫这样的能力增强者

00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:48,570
-都怪我  -不是的
- It's my fault. - That's not true.

234
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:52,180
那就把电视再打开  他们可指名道姓了
Then turn the TV back on, they're being very specific.

235
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:53,550
我早该拆除那件炸弹背心
I should've clocked that bomb vest

236
00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:55,440
而不是让你不得不动手
long before you have to deal with it.

237
00:19:56,850 --> 00:19:58,550
朗姆洛提到"巴基"

And people died.

240
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:14,100
-这怪我  -怪我们俩
- It's on me. - It's on both of us.

241
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,250
这份工作
This job...

242
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:22,120
我们尽可能救下更多的人
We try to save as many people as we can.

243
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:24,410
有时并不能救每个人
Sometimes that doesn't mean everybody,

244
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:26,500
但如果我们无法接受这一点
but, if we can't find a way to live with that,

245
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:27,630
下次
then next time...

246
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:31,340
也许我们谁都救不了
maybe nobody get saved.

247
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:37,690
小幻  我们谈过的
Vis, we talked about this.

248
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:40,400
是啊  但门开着  所以我以为
Yes. But the door was opened so I assumed that...

249
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:45,450
罗杰斯队长说斯塔克先生回来让我通知他
Captain Rogers wished to know when Mr. Stark was arriving.

250
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:47,210
谢谢  我马上下去
Thank you. I'll be right down.

251
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:49,530
我...走门
I'll... use the door.

252
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:52,850
还有  他带了位客人
Oh, and apparently, he's brought a guest.

253
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:54,030
你知道是谁吗
You know who it is?

254
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:56,410
国务卿
The Secretary of State.

255
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:03,480
五年前  我心脏病发作
5 years ago, I had a heart attack.

256
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:07,090
打高尔夫球后挥杆时昏了过去
and dropped right in the middle of my backswing.

257
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:10,060
结果  那成了我人生最大的幸事
Turned out, it was the best round of my life

258
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:14,260
因为经历了13小时的手术和三重搭桥术之后
because after 13 hours of surgery and a triple bypass.

259
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:19,220
我发现了四十年军队生涯没教过我的东西
I found something 40 years in the army never taught me:

260
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:21,370
远见

261
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:27,040
全世界欠复仇者联盟一个无法偿还的人情
The world owes the Avengers an unpayable debt.

262
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,880
你们为我们而战

263
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:34,420
保护了我们  拿生命冒险
Protected us. Risked your lives.

264
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:38,100
虽然有很多人把你们当成英雄
But while a great many people see you as heroes.

265
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:40,090
但也有一些人
There are some...

266
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:43,900
更愿意用"义务警员"这个词
who would prefer the word "vigilantes."

267
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:46,680
你会用哪个词  国务卿先生
And what word would you use, Mr. Secretary.

268
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,200
"危险"怎么样
How about "dangerous?"

269
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:53,720
你会如何形容一群驻扎在美国的能力增强者
What would you call a group of US-based, enhanced individuals,

270
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:56,480
习惯性地无视主权国家边界
who routinely ignores sovereign borders

271
00:21:56,490 --> 00:21:59,820
去哪  做什么  全凭自己意愿
and inflict their will wherever they choose

272
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:04,320
而且老实说  对造成的后果也似乎毫不关心
and who, frankly, seem unconcerned about what they leave behind.

273

过去四年中

你们的行动拥有无限权力而且无人监管

不再是私人组织

287
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,620
而是

要在一个联合国小组的监督下行动
they'll operate under the supervision of a United Nations Panel,

289

且是否出动要由该小组决定

队长  你知道托尔和班纳现在在哪吗
Tell me Captain, do you know where Thor and Banner are right now?

00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:53,590
我要是搞丢了两个30兆吨级的核武器
If I misplaced a couple of 30 megaton nukes,

294
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:55,870
肯定会有后果
you can bet there'd be consequences.

295
00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:00,640
妥协  保证  世界就是这样运作的
Compromise. Reassurance. That's how the world works.

296
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:03,830
相信我  这就是中间立场
Believe me, this is the middle ground.

297
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,650
有应急预案的吧

301
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:22,610
要是我们的决定你不喜欢呢
And if we come to a decision you don't like?

302
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,320
那你们就退休

神盾局陷落时
When S.H.I.E.L.D. fell,

见鬼去吧
Go to hell.

332
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:06,660
九头蛇活该灰飞烟灭
Hydra deserves its place on the ashheap,

333
00:27:06,910 --> 00:27:09,060
所以  我不介意杀你

334
00:27:10,010 --> 00:27:12,090
但你不说  我就得用这本书

335
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:15,860
和其他更血腥的手段  来找到我要的
and other bloodier methods to find what I need.

336
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:17,770
我并不想那样
I don't look forward to that.

337
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:23,180
而你的死  也只是保住了自尊
You'd only be dying for... your pride.

338
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:40,830
九头蛇万岁

你就完全不当回事吗
and you're just like, "No, that's cool. We got it."

347
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,330
你还要做多久两面派

-我有个方程式  -这样就明白了

也在同时上升

354
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:26,300
你是说  这是我们的错吗

355
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,640
我是说  这可能有因果关系

356
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:33,710
我们的超能力招来挑战

357
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:36,200
挑战激发冲突

358
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:37,770
而冲突

00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,530
会引发灾难

360

是我们应该给予考虑的

362

说到点上了
Boom.

363
00:28:50,610 --> 00:28:55,140
托尼  你安静得出奇啊

364

因为他已经决定好了
It's because he's already made up his mind.

天呐  你真懂我

实际上  是电磁头痛犯了
Actually, I'm nursing my electromagnetic headache.

367
00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:04,080
所以我才沉默  队长

368
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,440
就因为疼
It's just pain...

369
00:29:06,930 --> 00:29:08,430
不舒服
it's discomfort.

370
00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:10,940
是谁把咖啡渣倒进垃圾处理器了

我是给机车党开了家旅馆吗
Am I running a bed and breakfast for a biker gang?

372
00:29:20,210 --> 00:29:22,220
那是查尔斯·斯宾塞

是个好孩子  计算机工程专业

Had a floor-level gig at Intel planned for the fall.

376
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:32,470
但是  他想趁窝在办公室里之前
But first, he wanted to put a few miles on his soul,

377
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,200
先去积累阅历
before he park it behind a desk.

378
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,410
看看世界  做做义工
See the world, maybe be of service.

379
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:39,520
查理不想去维加斯或劳德尔堡
Charlie didn't want to go to Vegas or Fort Lauderdale

380
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,310
要我就会选那些地方
which is what I would do.

381
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:43,220
也没去巴黎或阿姆斯特丹  那儿多有趣
He didn't go to Paris or Amsterdam, which sounds fun.

382
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:45,280
他想利用暑假
He decided to spend his summer,

383
00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:47,020
给穷人建生态住宅
building sustainable housing for the poor.

384
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:48,620
猜猜是哪  索科威亚
Guess where, Sokovia.

385
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,080
他可能是想做出些改变
He wanted to make a difference, I suppose.

386
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:54,820
但我们无从得知了
I mean, we won't know

387
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:56,060
因为我们打得正高兴时
cause we dropped a building on him

388
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:57,810
向他身上砸了一栋楼
while we were kicking ass.

389
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:07,840
我们完全没有决策程序
There's no decision making process here.

390
00:30:10,130 --> 00:30:11,660
我们需要受到管制
We need to be put in check.

391
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:13,460
不管以什么形式  我都接受
Whatever form that takes, I'm game.

392
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:15,970
如果不受限制  我们就会无法无天
If we can't accept limitations, if we're bounderless,

393
00:30:15,970 --> 00:30:18,350
比坏人好不到哪去
we're no better than the bad guys.

394
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:20,530
托尼  有人死在你眼皮下
Tony, someone dies on your watch,

395
00:30:20,530 --> 00:30:21,070
你不能就此放弃
you don't give up.

396
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:21,950
谁说我们要放弃了
Who said we're giving up?

397
00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:24,750
如果不对自己的行为负责  就是放弃
We are, for not taking responsibility for our actions.

398
00:30:24,910 --> 00:30:26,390
这些文件只是在推卸责任
These documents just shifts the blames.

399
00:30:26,390 --> 00:30:27,880
对不起  史蒂夫
I'm sorry, Steve, that...

400
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:30,230
这话自负得危险
That is dangerously arrogant.

401
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,280
这可是联合国啊
This is the United Nations we're talking about.

402
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:34,850
不是世界安全理事会
It's not the World Security Council,

403
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:36,220
不是神盾局  也不是九头蛇
it's not S.H.I.E.L.D., it's not Hydra.

404
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:38,240
对  但管理者仍是人  人有目的
No, but it's run by people with agendas

405
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,010
而目的会变
and agendas change.

406
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:41,010
那是好事  所以我才会在这儿
That's good. That's why I'm here.

407
00:30:41,010 --> 00:30:42,900
当我意识到我的武器落入敌手
When I realized what my weapons were capable of

408
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:43,960
后果会多不堪设想时
in the wrong hands,

409
00:30:43,990 --> 00:30:45,650
我就停止生产了
I shut it down, stopped manufacturing...

410
00:30:45,650 --> 00:30:48,070
托尼  那是你的选择
Tony. You chose to do that.

411
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:50,580
如果我们签字  就放弃了选择权
If we sign this, we surrender our right to choose.

412
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:54,320
如果小组派我们去不该去的地方
What if this Panel sends us somewhere we don't think we should go.

413
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:57,190
或是不许我们去该去的地方呢
What if there's somewhere we need to go, and they don't let us.

414
00:30:57,310 --> 00:31:00,450
我们也许不完美  但仍是最可靠的人
We may not be perfect, but the safest hands are still our own.

415
00:31:00,450 --> 00:31:04,640
如果现在不签  将来他们会强迫我们签
If we don't do this now, it's going to be done to us later.

416
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,510
事实就是如此  到时会闹得很不好看
That's the fact. That won't be pretty.

417
00:31:06,510 --> 00:31:09,640
-你是说他们会来抓我  -我们会保护你的
- You're saying they'll come for me. - We would protect you.

418
00:31:09,690 --> 00:31:11,120
或许托尼是对的
Maybe Tony's right.

419
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:16,260
如果我们稍作妥协  就还有回旋余地
If, we have one hand on the wheel we can still steer.

420
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:17,530
但如果彻底决裂...
If we take it off...

421
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:18,420
你还是不是
Aren't you the same woman

422
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:20,630
几年前跟政府叫板的那个女人了
who told the government to kiss her ass a few years ago?

423
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:23,560
我这是...审时度势
I'm just... reading the terrain.

424
00:31:23,570 --> 00:31:26,920
我们在公众面前犯了些大错
We have made some very public mistakes.

425
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:28,470
我们需要重获他们的信任
We need to win their trust back.

426
00:31:28,490 --> 00:31:29,280
慢着
Focus up.

427
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:32,020
抱歉  是我听错了吗  你是在支持我吗
I'm sorry, did I just mishear you or did you agree with me.

428
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:34,510
-我想反悔了  -不不  不能收回
- Oh, I want to take it back. - No, no, no. You can't retract it.

429
00:31:34,570 --> 00:31:36,680
谢谢啊  真是破天荒
Thank you. Unprecedented.

430
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:38,860
好了  这事结了
Okay, case close.

现在
And now,

437
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:28,470
我想请莎伦·卡特
I would like to invite Sharon Carter,

438
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:30,590
上台说几句
to come up and say a few words.

439
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:46,710
玛格丽特·卡特为人熟知的身份是神盾局创始人
Margaret Carter was known to most as a founder of S.H.I.E.L.D.

440
00:32:47,730 --> 00:32:50,130
但对我来说  她只是佩吉姑妈
But I just knew her as Aunt Peggy.

441
00:32:52,130 --> 00:32:54,290
她办公室有张相片
She had a photograph in her office.

442
00:32:54,290 --> 00:32:57,160
佩吉姑妈跟肯尼迪并肩而站
Aunt Peggy standing next to JFK.

443
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:00,260
作为孩子  这让我觉得很酷
As a kid, that was pretty cool.

444
00:33:00,430 --> 00:33:02,420
但这也是很大的压力
But, it was a lot to live up to.

445
00:33:02,670 --> 00:33:05,530
所以我从不告诉别人我们是亲戚
Which is why I never told anyone we were related.

446
00:33:06,570 --> 00:33:07,660
有一次我问她
I asked her once

447
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:10,900
在女性饱受歧视的时代
how she managed to master diplomacy and espionage

448
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:14,860
她是如何成为一名成功的外交官和间谍的
in a time when no one wanted to see a woman succeed at either.

449
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:17,830
她回答说  能妥协就妥协
She said, compromise where you can.

450
00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:21,530
不能妥协就坚持己见
But where you can't, don't.

451
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:24,780
即使你身边所有人
Even if everyone is telling you

452
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:28,150
都把错的说成对的
that something wrong is something right.

453
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:31,360
即使全世界都叫你让开
Even if the whole world is telling you to move.

454
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:35,550
你必须如大树般稳稳站住
It is your duty, to plant yourself like a tree,

455
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,670
直视他们的眼睛说  "不...
look them in they eye and say, "No...

456
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:39,800
你让开"
... you move."

457
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:53,210
被解冻后
When I came out of the ice,

458
00:33:53,910 --> 00:33:55,720
我以为我认识的人都死了
I thought everyone I had known was gone.

459
00:33:57,010 --> 00:33:59,030
后来知道她还活着
When I found out that she was alive,

460
00:34:00,170 --> 00:34:01,910
只觉得还有她在很幸运
I was just lucky to have her.

461
00:34:02,370 --> 00:34:04,220
有你也是她的幸运
She had you back too.

462
00:34:06,450 --> 00:34:07,660
还有谁签字了
Who else signed it.

Clint?

-旺达呢  -待定
- Wanda? - TBD.

I'm off to Vienna for the signing of the Accords.

468
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,910
飞机上还有好多空位
There's plenty of room on the jet.

469
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:30,410
这虽然是最轻松的路
Just because it's the path of least resistance

470
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:32,630
不代表就是错的路
doesn't mean it's the wrong path.

471
00:34:32,730 --> 00:34:35,460
团结比团结的方式更重要
Staying together is more important than how we stay together.

472
00:34:36,810 --> 00:34:38,250
那我们要为此放弃什么
What are we giving up to do it?

473
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:46,170
抱歉  小娜  我不能签
I'm sorry, Nat. I can't sign it.

那你来干吗
Then what are you doing here?

476
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:57,300

I didn't want you to be alone.

00:39:11,530 --> 00:39:12,680
他们确认此人正是
who they have identified

546
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:15,510
冬日战士詹姆斯·布坎南·巴恩斯
as James Buchanan Barnes, the Winter Soldier.

547
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:17,130
这名臭名昭著的九头蛇特工
The infamous Hydra agent,

548
00:39:17,130 --> 00:39:20,550
与数起恐怖袭击和政治暗杀有牵连
linked to numerous acts of terrorism and political assassinations.

549
00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:21,900
我得去工作了
I have to go to work.

550
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:28,810
给军情六处打电话
Call MI6

551
00:39:28,810 --> 00:39:31,080
看看能否让微取证小组快速行动
see if we can get Micro Forensics to hurry this up.

552
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:33,610
两小时内得赶过来  不然就没意义了
We need the whole team here in two hours or it's not worth it.

553
00:39:44,130 --> 00:39:45,320
我非常抱歉
I'm very sorry.

554
00:39:52,070 --> 00:39:56,930
在我的文化里  死亡并不是终结
In my culture, death, is not the end.

555
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:01,690
更像是  前往陌生领域的起点
It's more of a... stepping-off point.

556
00:40:02,730 --> 00:40:06,360
你向芭丝特与塞赫麦特伸出双手
You reach out with both hands and Bast and Sekhmet,

557
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:08,870
他们带你走进绿草原  在那里
they lead you into the green veldt where....

558
00:40:10,270 --> 00:40:11,760
你可以永远奔跑下去
you can run forever.

559
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:15,150
听起来非常安宁
That sounds very peaceful.

560
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,160
我父亲也这样认为
My father thought so.

561
00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:22,030
但是我不是我的父亲
I am not my father.

562
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:23,670
特查拉
T'Challa.

563
00:40:24,390 --> 00:40:27,220
特遣队会决定谁去抓巴恩斯
Task Force will decide who brings in Barnes.

564
00:40:29,150 --> 00:40:30,860
不必了  罗曼诺夫小姐
Don't bother, Miss. Romanoff.

565
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:34,120
我会亲手杀了他
I'll kill him myself.

566
00:40:40,810 --> 00:40:42,360
-喂  -你还好吗
- Yeah? - Are you alright?

567
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:45,510
还行  谢谢关心  我挺幸运的
Ah, yeah, thanks. I..I got lucky.

568
00:40:51,410 --> 00:40:54,990
我知道你多在乎巴恩斯  真的
I know how much Barnes means to you. I really do.

569
00:40:56,070 --> 00:40:57,470
待在家里  别出来
Stay home.

570
00:40:58,090 --> 00:41:02,020
你只会让局面更糟  让我们都不好做  求你
You'll only make this worse for all of us. Please.

571
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:03,910
-你是说你要逮捕我吗  -不
- Are you saying you'll arrest me? - No.

572
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:09,020
如果你出手  会有人抓你的  现在就是这样了
Someone will, if you interfere. That's how it works now.

573
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:10,870
要是他都变成这样了  小娜
If he's this far gone, Nat,

574
00:41:11,270 --> 00:41:12,560
那就该由我去抓他
I should be the one to bring him in.

575
00:41:12,570 --> 00:41:13,410
为什么
Why?

576
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:15,730
因为我是最不可能因此丧命的人
Because I'm the one least likely to die trying.

577
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:19,690
该死
Shit.

578
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:25,270
她叫你别插手吗
She tell you to stay out of it?

579
00:41:27,490 --> 00:41:29,690
-她或许有些道理  -他也会为我出手的
- Might have a point. - He'd do it for me.

580
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:31,440
要在1945年还有可能
1945, maybe.

581
00:41:31,450 --> 00:41:33,930
我只是想确保我们考虑周全了
I just want to make sure we consider all our options.

582
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:37,830
冲你开枪的人  通常最终也会冲我开枪
The people that shoot at you, usually wind up shooting at me.

583
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:42,790
录像公布后收到了很多线报
Tips have been pouring in since that footage went public.

584
00:41:42,930 --> 00:41:45,380
人人都觉得冬日战士跟他们去一家健身房
Everybody thinks the Winter Soldier goes to their gym.

585
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:48,330
大部分线索都没有价值  除了这一条
Most of it is noise, except for this.

586
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:52,730
我的上司现在就要简报
My boss expects a briefing pretty much now,

587
00:41:52,730 --> 00:41:54,630
只能给你这么多情报了
so that's all the answer you're gonna get.

588
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:57,460
-谢谢  -你得抓紧时间
- Thank you. - And you're going to have to hurry.

589
00:41:58,420 --> 00:42:00,390
我们的命令是当场击毙
We have orders to shoot on sight.

590
00:42:03,210 --> 00:42:10,080
回祖国
Возвращение на родину.

591
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:12,840
一
Один.

592
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:13,820
一
Один.

593
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:20,320
火车货车车厢
Грузовой вагон.

594
00:42:31,030 --> 00:42:32,120
穆勒先生
Herr Müller.

595
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:33,730
您的早餐
Ich haben Ihr Frühstück.

596
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,830
隔着门就闻到了
Ich kann das schon von weitem riechen.

597
00:42:40,370 --> 00:42:42,320
培根和黑咖啡
Speck und schwarzer Kaffee.

598
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:42,880
还是老样子
Wieder.

599
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:45,010
如果您需要  我可以做点儿别的
Ich kann Ihnen was Anderes machen, wenn Sie das möchten...

600
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:46,490
这就很好
Bitte sehr, das ist wunderbar...

601
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:47,120
我帮您端到...
Ich stelle das mal her...

602
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:49,640
没关系  我自己来就好
Es geht schon, es geht schon. Ich mache das.

603
00:43:00,370 --> 00:43:01,120
{\an2}{\pos(191,231)}-这个怎么样  -很好的

604
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:03,350
{\an2}{\pos(191,231)}那好

605
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:08,100
{\an2}{\pos(191,231)}那我要六个

606
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:10,780
{\an2}{\pos(191,231)}给你  谢谢

607
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:17,450
{\an8}{\pos(192,181)}布加勒斯特

608
00:43:44,310 --> 00:43:46,470
{\an8}冬日战士因维也纳爆炸事件被通缉

609
00:44:23,170 --> 00:44:24,230
注意  队长
Heads up, Cap.

610
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:26,600
德国特种部队从南面过来了
German special forces approaching from the south.

611
00:44:27,410 --> 00:44:28,500
收到
Understood.

612
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:38,580
你认得我吗
Do you know me?

613
00:44:41,660 --> 00:44:42,910
你是史蒂夫
You're Steve.

614
00:44:43,860 --> 00:44:45,810
我在博物馆里了解过你
I read about you in a museum.

615
00:44:46,140 --> 00:44:47,440
他们设置了警戒线
They've set the perimeter.

616
00:44:49,530 --> 00:44:50,850
我知道你有点紧张
I know you're nervous.

617
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:53,120
你也有理由紧张
And you have plenty of reason to be.

618
00:44:54,630 --> 00:44:55,690
但你在撒谎
But you're lying.

619
00:44:57,180 --> 00:44:59,190
我没去维也纳  我不做那种事了
I wasn't in Vienna. I don't do that anymore.

620
00:44:59,190 --> 00:45:00,580
他们进入大楼了
They're entering the building.

621
00:45:00,580 --> 00:45:02,960
认为是你的人要来了
Well, the people who think you did are coming here now.

622
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:05,130
他们没准备留你活口
And they're not planning on taking you alive.

623
00:45:05,130 --> 00:45:08,250
很聪明  好策略
That's smart. Good strategy.

624
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:11,510
他们上楼顶了  我得撤了
They're on the roof. I'm compromised.

625
00:45:14,530 --> 00:45:16,460
我们不非得打起来  巴基
This doesn't have end in a fight, Buck.

626
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:23,800
-总是要打起来的  -还有5秒
- It always ends in a fight. - 5 seconds.

627
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:27,410
你从河里救我出来  为什么
You pulled me from the river. Why?

628
00:45:28,310 --> 00:45:30,220
-不知道  -3秒
- I don't know. - 3 seconds!

629
00:45:30,220 --> 00:45:31,290
你知道的
Yes, you do.

630
00:45:32,860 --> 00:45:34,830
突破  突破  突破
Breach! Breach! Breach!

631
00:45:38,390 --> 00:45:39,330
把门撞开
Schieß die Tür auf!

632
00:45:54,780 --> 00:45:55,850
巴基  住手
Buck, stop!

633
00:45:56,570 --> 00:45:57,840
你会杀死谁的
You're gonna kill someone.

634
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:02,140
我谁都不会杀
I'm not gonna kill anyone.

635
00:46:47,580 --> 00:46:48,990
嫌犯已逃跑
Der Verdächtige ist ausgebrochen!

636
00:46:48,990 --> 00:46:50,990
他顺东楼梯井下去了
Er ging nach Ost gegen den Treppenschacht.

637
00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:03,390
拜托  伙计
Come on, man.

638
00:48:07,990 --> 00:48:10,580
-山姆  去西南屋顶  -另一个人是谁
- Sam, southwest rooftop. - Who the hell is the other guy?

639
00:48:10,670 --> 00:48:12,010
马上就知道了
About to find out.

640
00:48:24,780 --> 00:48:26,400
-山姆  -我来
- Sam. - Got it.

641
00:49:08,300 --> 00:49:09,600
站住
Stand down!

642
00:49:12,430 --> 00:49:13,670
站住
Stand down!

643
00:49:42,380 --> 00:49:43,500
山姆  我甩不掉这人
Sam, I can't shake this guy.

644
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:45,230
就来
Right behind you.

645
00:51:20,180 --> 00:51:22,580
立刻投降
Stand down. Now.

646
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:33,110
恭喜你  队长  你是罪犯了
Congratulations, Cap. You're a criminal.

647
00:51:56,030 --> 00:51:57,240
国王陛下
Your Highness.

648
00:52:03,390 --> 00:52:05,080
放少许辣椒粉
A pinch of paprika.

649
00:52:05,780 --> 00:52:07,010
少许是多少
A pinch.

650
00:52:10,540 --> 00:52:11,990
那是辣椒粉吗
Is that paprikash?

651
00:52:12,420 --> 00:52:16,100
我想这或许能让你振奋精神
I thought it might... lift your spirits.

652
00:52:29,310 --> 00:52:31,210
精神振奋了
Spirits lifted.

653
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:35,960
不好意思  我从来没有
In my defense, I..I haven't actually ever...

654
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:38,940
-吃过东西  -能让我来吗
- ...eaten anything before, so... - May I.

655
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:40,050
请吧
Please.

656
00:52:47,070 --> 00:52:47,970
旺达
Wanda.

657
00:52:48,950 --> 00:52:50,820
没人讨厌你
No one dislikes you, Wanda.

658
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:54,920
-谢谢  -不客气
- Thanks. - Oh, you're welcome.

659
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:56,250
我的意思是
No. It's a...

660
00:52:56,250 --> 00:52:58,590
这是杏仁体的一种下意识反应
involuntary response in their amygdala

661
00:52:58,590 --> 00:53:00,880
他们控制不住害怕你
they can't help but be afraid of you.

662
00:53:00,890 --> 00:53:02,090
你也怕我吗
Are you?

663
00:53:02,190 --> 00:53:04,210
我的杏仁体是人造的  所以
My amygdala is synthetic, so...

664
00:53:07,470 --> 00:53:10,120
我以前对自己有一定的看法
I used to think of myself one way.

665
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:14,150
但是  自从有了异能
But, after this.

666
00:53:14,830 --> 00:53:16,940
我就变了
I am something else.

667
00:53:17,100 --> 00:53:20,110
我还是那个我
I'm still me, I think.

668
00:53:20,180 --> 00:53:25,720
但世人不这么看了
But... that's not what everyone else sees.

669
00:53:28,530 --> 00:53:30,180
我不知道这是什么东西
Do you know, I don't know what this is.

670
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:32,880
并不清楚
Not really.

671
00:53:33,370 --> 00:53:35,010
它不属于这个世界
I know it's not of this world.

672
00:53:35,020 --> 00:53:36,430
它给洛基的权杖供能
But it powered Loki staff,

673
00:53:36,430 --> 00:53:38,530
也让你拥有了异能  但是
gave you your abilities. But...

674
00:53:40,370 --> 00:53:43,810
它的真正属性依然未知
its true nature is a mystery.

675
00:53:43,910 --> 00:53:45,910
而它是我的一部分
And yet, it is part of me.

676
00:53:45,930 --> 00:53:47,470
你怕它吗
Are you afraid of it?

677
00:53:47,630 --> 00:53:49,510
我想了解它
I wish to understand it.

678
00:53:50,390 --> 00:53:52,600
我越了解它  它对我的控制就越小
The more I do, the less it controls me.

679
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:57,500
或许有天  我还能控制它
One day, who knows, I may even control it.

680
00:53:59,730 --> 00:54:03,930
我不知道这是什么  但肯定不是辣椒粉
I don't know what's in this but it is not paprika.

681
00:54:04,550 --> 00:54:09,140
我去趟商店  20分钟就回来
I'm gonna go to the store, I'll be back in 20 minutes.

682
00:54:09,260 --> 00:54:12,380
或者  我们可以订披萨
Alternatively, we could order a pizza?

要怎么处置他

按说你们也该跟他一样

这是橄榄枝  是这么说的吗

不  绝对没有  我们分手了

谁都没有错

747
00:58:43,020 --> 00:58:44,880
抱歉  托尼  我不知道

几年前我差点失去她

749
00:58:46,340 --> 00:58:48,270
于是我毁了我所有的战甲

然后我们不得不对付九头蛇

因为事实就是我不想停

我不想失去她

755
00:59:02,990 --> 00:59:05,340
我想或许《协议》是个折衷的办法
I thought maybe the Accords could split the difference.

756
00:59:09,240 --> 00:59:11,000
替她说一句  我很难搞

他从没提过  可能就提过一千次吧
He never mentioned that. Maybe only a thousand times.

763

天啊  我以前真恨你

我不是有意让你为难
I don't mean to make things difficult.

I know. Because you're a very polite person.

771
00:59:53,720 --> 00:59:55,370
但我不希望你离开
But I don't wanna see you gone.

772
00:59:55,960 --> 00:59:57,140
我们需要你  队长

773
00:59:58,150 --> 00:59:59,720
现在还没出什么不可挽回的事
So far nothing's happened that can't be undone,

774

我们可以把这24小时的行动合法化

777
01:00:06,070 --> 01:00:08,000
而不是瓦坎达监狱

778
01:00:20,430 --> 01:00:22,080
也不是绝对不行  但是
I'm not saying it's impossible. But

779
01:00:22,190 --> 01:00:23,670
得有保障措施

818
01:02:31,550 --> 01:02:32,720
-这里吗  -对
- Hier? - Ja.

819
01:02:40,020 --> 01:02:42,850
特遣队为什么要公布这张照片
Why would the task force release this photo to begin with?

820
01:02:43,020 --> 01:02:45,130
把消息传出去  让更多人来找
Get the word out, involve as many eyes as we can?

821
01:02:45,130 --> 01:02:46,180
是啊
Right.

822
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:48,310
这是逼的人没法藏身的好方法
It's a good way to flush a guy out of hiding.

823
01:02:48,440 --> 01:02:50,300
引爆炸弹  被人拍到
Set off a bomb, get your picture taken.

824
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:52,470
让七十亿人寻找冬日战士
Get 7 billion people looking for the Winter soldier.

825
01:02:52,470 --> 01:02:54,540
你是说有人为找他而陷害他
You're saying someone framed him to find him.

826
01:02:54,580 --> 01:02:57,140
史蒂夫  我们找了他两年都一无所获
Steve, we looked for the guy for 2 years and found nothing.

827
01:02:57,180 --> 01:02:59,140
我们没炸联合国  这可非常引人注目
We didn't bomb the UN. That turns a lot of heads.

828
01:02:59,140 --> 01:03:00,210
对  但这不能保证
Yeah. But that doesn't guarantee

829
01:03:00,210 --> 01:03:01,810
陷害他的人能找到他
that whoever framed him would get him,

830
01:03:01,810 --> 01:03:03,240
只能保证我们会找到他
it guarantees that we would.

831
01:03:10,070 --> 01:03:10,940
是啊
Yeah.

832
01:03:13,620 --> 01:03:14,680
告诉我  巴基
Tell me Bucky.

833
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:17,330
你目睹了很多事  对吧
You've seen a great deal, haven't you?

834
01:03:19,250 --> 01:03:21,030
我不想说
I don't want to talk about it.

835
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:23,020
你觉得
You feel that...

836
01:03:23,030 --> 01:03:26,030
你一旦开口  恐怖就无法停止了
if you open your mouth, the horrors might never stop.

837
01:03:30,280 --> 01:03:31,400
别担心
Don't worry.

838
01:03:31,630 --> 01:03:32,830
{\an8}{\pos(222,132)}包裹已送达

839
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:36,500
我们只谈一件事
We only have to talk about one.

840
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:48,880
这是什么
Was ist das?

841
01:04:00,130 --> 01:04:02,150
赶紧的  各位  让我看到巴恩斯
Alright. Come on, guys. Get me eyes on Barnes.

842
01:04:02,150 --> 01:04:03,110
快
Go.

843
01:04:03,300 --> 01:04:06,340
星期五  能查到电力中断的源头吗
F.R.I.D.A.Y. Can you get me a source on that outage?

844
01:04:07,730 --> 01:04:09,270
东地下5层
Sub-level 5, east wing.

845
01:04:13,160 --> 01:04:16,340
-怎么回事  -我们来谈谈你的家乡吧
- What the hell is this? - Why don't we discuss your home?

846
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:19,510
不是罗马尼亚  也不是布鲁克林
Not Romania. Certainly not Brooklyn, no.

847
01:04:20,740 --> 01:04:24,340
我是说  你真正的家
I mean, your real home.

848
01:04:29,930 --> 01:04:31,160
渴望
Желание.

849
01:04:31,930 --> 01:04:32,600
不要
No.

850
01:04:34,100 --> 01:04:35,300
生锈
Ржаый.

851
01:04:35,530 --> 01:04:36,390
快停下
Stop.

852
01:04:36,740 --> 01:04:38,140
十七
Семнадцать.

853
01:04:40,120 --> 01:04:40,950
停下
Stop.

帮帮我

865
01:05:49,770 --> 01:05:50,630
帮帮忙

866
01:05:54,170 --> 01:05:55,010
起来
Get up.

867
01:05:58,260 --> 01:06:00,010
你是谁  你想干什么
Who are you? What do you want?

868
01:06:01,710 --> 01:06:03,620
毁灭一个帝国
To see an empire fall.

869
01:06:43,610 --> 01:06:44,810
疏散所有民众

870
01:06:44,810 --> 01:06:47,200
在大楼周围拉起警戒  派出武装直升机
Get me a perimeter around the building and gunships in the air.

871
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:48,590
你带战衣[西装]了吧
Please tell me you brought a suit.

872
01:06:48,600 --> 01:06:50,220
当然带了  汤姆·福特的
Sure did. It's a lovely Tom Ford,

873
01:06:50,220 --> 01:06:51,410
三件套  两扣
three-Piece, 2 button...

874
01:06:51,450 --> 01:06:53,310
我现在是现役非战斗人员
I'm a active duty, non combatant.

875
01:06:53,770 --> 01:06:54,680
跟我来
Follow me.

876
01:07:12,160 --> 01:07:13,340
我们就位了
We're in position.

877
01:07:45,650 --> 01:07:47,670
你至少还认得我吧
You could at least recognise me.

878
01:08:40,430 --> 01:08:41,430
该死
Damn it.

879
01:10:19,140 --> 01:10:20,990
他又问了我一次  你会不会来
He asked me again if you're going to be there?

880
01:10:20,990 --> 01:10:23,240
我说我不知道
I said I wasn't sure.

881
01:10:23,530 --> 01:10:26,060
你真该看到他那张小脸  尽量赶回来  好吗
You should've seen his little face. Just try, okay?

882
01:10:26,990 --> 01:10:29,960
我要睡了  我爱你
I'm going to bed. I love you.

883
01:10:33,510 --> 01:10:35,400
维也纳联合国爆炸案
James Barnes, der mit dem Bombenanschlag

884
01:10:35,400 --> 01:10:37,500
嫌疑人詹姆斯·巴恩斯
auf die UN in Wien in Verbindung gebracht wird,

885
01:10:37,500 --> 01:10:39,400
今日脱逃羁押
ist heute aus dem Haft entflohen.

886
01:10:39,410 --> 01:10:42,640
同时失踪的还有复仇者史蒂夫·罗杰斯队长
Ebenfalls vermisst werden der Avenger Captain Steve Rogers...

887
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:44,060
和山姆·威尔逊
und Sam Wilson.

888
01:10:47,970 --> 01:10:50,120
{\an8}莫斯科

889
01:11:08,130 --> 01:11:09,000
队长
Hey, Cap!

890
01:11:21,940 --> 01:11:22,870
史蒂夫
Steve.

891
01:11:24,110 --> 01:11:25,590
是哪一个巴基在说话
Which Bucky am I talking to?

892
01:11:27,900 --> 01:11:29,630
你妈妈的名字叫萨拉
Your mom's name is Sarah.

893
01:11:34,160 --> 01:11:37,370
你以前会往鞋里垫报纸
You used to wear newspapers in your shoes.

894
01:11:38,920 --> 01:11:39,860
博物馆里可不会讲这个
Can't read that in a museum.

895
01:11:39,860 --> 01:11:42,020
这就行了  就没事了
Just like that, we're suppose to be cool?

896
01:11:42,540 --> 01:11:44,400
-我做了什么  -不少
- What did I do? - Enough.

897
01:11:44,410 --> 01:11:46,360
天哪  我就知道会这样
Oh god, I knew this would happen.

898
01:11:46,590 --> 01:11:48,800
九头蛇给我灌输的东西都还在
Everything Hydra put inside me is still there.

899
01:11:49,260 --> 01:11:51,010
他只要说几个词就能激发
All he had to do was say the god damn words.

900
01:11:51,010 --> 01:11:52,760
-他是谁  -我不知道
- Who was he? - I don't know.

901
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:55,250
那场陷害你的爆炸  害死了很多人
People are dead. The bombing. The set up.

902
01:11:55,250 --> 01:11:57,360
那个医生大费周章  就为跟你待上10分钟
The doctor did all that just to get 10 minutes with you.

903
01:11:57,360 --> 01:11:59,740
你不能只说句"我不知道"
I need you to do better than "I don't know."

904
01:12:02,830 --> 01:12:05,400
他想知道西伯利亚的事
He wanted to know about Siberia.

905
01:12:08,650 --> 01:12:09,950
我被关押的地方
Where I was kept.

906
01:12:12,270 --> 01:12:13,970
他想知道具体位置
He wanted to know exactly where.

907
01:12:13,970 --> 01:12:15,410
他为什么要知道这个
Why would he need to know that?

908
01:12:18,300 --> 01:12:20,490
因为冬日战士不止我一个
Because I'm not the only Winter Soldier.

909
01:13:52,900 --> 01:13:54,940
很好
Очень хорошо, Волков.

910
01:14:05,020 --> 01:14:06,930
带我出去
Солдат, пошли отсюда.

911
01:14:21,400 --> 01:14:24,420
-他们是谁  -精英敢死队
- Who were they? - Their most elite death squad.

912
01:14:24,710 --> 01:14:26,960
九头蛇史上杀人数最多的
More kills than anyone in Hydra history.

913
01:14:27,010 --> 01:14:28,140
那还是在注射血清之前
And that was before the serum.

914
01:14:28,140 --> 01:14:29,540
他们都变得跟你一样吗
They all turned out like you?

915
01:14:29,540 --> 01:14:30,550
更糟
Worse.

916
01:14:31,300 --> 01:14:33,250
那个医生能控制他们吗
The doctor, can he control them?

917
01:14:34,100 --> 01:14:35,040
八九不离十
Enough.

918
01:14:35,640 --> 01:14:37,130
他说他想毁灭一个帝国
Said he wanted to see an empire fall.

919
01:14:37,130 --> 01:14:38,700
有那些人的帮助  他就做得到
With these guys he could do it.

920
01:14:38,770 --> 01:14:41,550
他们会30种语言  来去不着痕迹
They speak 30 languages, can hide in plain sight,

921
01:14:41,770 --> 01:14:44,000
渗透  暗杀  颠覆
infiltrate, assassinate, destabilize,

922
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,180
他们能在一夜之间毁灭一个国家
they can take a whole country down in one night.

923
01:14:46,180 --> 01:14:48,030
打得你措手不及
You'd never see them coming.

924
01:14:50,180 --> 01:14:52,320
搁在一周前这事会简单得多
This would've been a lot easier a week ago.

925
01:14:52,870 --> 01:14:53,820
如果我们告诉托尼
If we call Tony.

926
01:14:53,820 --> 01:14:55,420
-他不会相信的  -即便他信
- No, he won't believe us. - Even if he did...

927
01:14:55,420 --> 01:14:57,710
谁知道《协议》会不会允许他帮忙
Who knows if the Accords would let him help.

928
01:14:59,220 --> 01:15:00,360
我们只能靠自己
We're on our own.

929
01:15:01,540 --> 01:15:02,630
未必
Maybe not.

930
01:15:04,290 --> 01:15:05,570
我认识一个人
I know a guy.

931
01:15:06,520 --> 01:15:10,290
我猜你不知道他们在哪吧
I don't suppose you have any idea where they are.

932
01:15:10,290 --> 01:15:12,620
会知道的  边防9队守着国界
We will. GSG-9's got the borders covered.

933
01:15:12,620 --> 01:15:14,630
侦察机也在全天候搜查
Recons flying 24/7.

934
01:15:14,950 --> 01:15:16,120
他们会有发现  我们就去处理
They'll get a hit. We'll handle it.

935
01:15:16,120 --> 01:15:18,300
你不明白  斯塔克  这事不归你处理
You don't get it, Stark. It's not yours to handle.

936
01:15:18,360 --> 01:15:20,660
你显然无法客观对待此事
It's clear you can't be objective.

937
01:15:20,760 --> 01:15:22,320
我要让特种部队负责
I'm putting special ops on this.

938
01:15:22,320 --> 01:15:23,800
如果交上了火怎么办
And what happens when the shooting starts?

939
01:15:23,810 --> 01:15:24,960
你要杀了史蒂夫·罗杰斯吗
What, do you kill Steve Rogers?

940
01:15:24,960 --> 01:15:26,590
如果他不乖乖就范
If we're provoked.

941
01:15:26,590 --> 01:15:28,620
要不是罗杰斯  我们在罗马尼亚
Barnes would've been eliminate in Romania

942
01:15:28,620 --> 01:15:30,180
就能消灭巴恩斯了
if it wasn't for Rogers.

943
01:15:30,180 --> 01:15:33,820
有些本不该死的人因此丧命
There are dead people who would be alive now.

944
01:15:34,910 --> 01:15:36,440
你倒想想我说没说错
Feel free to check my math.

945
01:15:36,450 --> 01:15:37,220
无意冒犯
All due respect,

946
01:15:37,220 --> 01:15:39,820
这事凭武力是解决不了的  罗斯
you're not gonna solve this with boys and bullets, Ross.

947
01:15:39,820 --> 01:15:40,900
你得让我们去抓他
You got to let us bring him in.

948
01:15:40,900 --> 01:15:43,050
这次和上次又会有什么不同
How would that end any differently than last time?

949
01:15:43,060 --> 01:15:46,670
这次我不会穿便装行动
Because this time I won't be wearing Loafers and a silk shirt.

950
01:15:47,050 --> 01:15:49,270
72小时  我保证
72 hours, guarantee.

951
01:15:49,470 --> 01:15:50,840
36小时
36 hours.

952
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:54,130
巴恩斯
Barnes.

953
01:15:55,610 --> 01:15:56,770
罗杰斯
Rogers.

954
01:15:57,430 --> 01:15:58,610
威尔逊
Wilson.

955
01:15:58,660 --> 01:15:59,830
多谢  先生
Thank you, sir.

956
01:16:04,460 --> 01:16:06,460
我左臂麻了  这是正常现象吗
My left arm is numb, is that normal?

957
01:16:09,570 --> 01:16:10,720
你还好吗
You alright?

958
01:16:11,230 --> 01:16:12,340

- We're seriously understaffed. - Oh, yeah.

961
01:16:21,850 --> 01:16:24,950
如果绿巨人在就好了  有他的线索吗
It would be great if we had a hulk, right about now. Any shot?

962
01:16:26,870 --> 01:16:29,240
你真觉得他会站我们这边吗
You really think he'd be on our side?

963
01:16:29,700 --> 01:16:30,730
不会
No.

964
01:16:30,740 --> 01:16:33,270

我们该见见了  你收到我邮件了吧

982
01:17:38,640 --> 01:17:40,840
这事现在就算成了
So now, we're in business.

983
01:17:41,230 --> 01:17:43,100
你都没告诉过我  这是怎么回事
You didn't tell me anything. What's up with that?

984
01:17:43,100 --> 01:17:44,420
-你现在还瞒我事了吗  -我只是...
- You're keeping secrets from me? - Why, I just...

985
01:17:44,420 --> 01:17:45,990
我知道你很喜欢惊喜
I just know how much you love surprises,

986
01:17:45,990 --> 01:17:48,900
所以我想等回头再告诉你
so I thought I would let you know... wh...

987
01:17:49,160 --> 01:17:50,250
话说回来  我申请了什么
Anyway, what did I apply for?

988
01:17:50,260 --> 01:17:51,070
这就是我来要解决的事
That's what I'm here to hash out.

989
01:17:51,070 --> 01:17:52,930
好  解决  好吧
Okay, hash, hash out, okay.

990
01:17:52,930 --> 01:17:55,740
她居然都当婶婶了  简直难以置信
It's so hard for me to believe that she's someone's aunt.

991
01:17:55,740 --> 01:17:58,600
对啊  什么样的婶婶都有嘛
Yeah well, we come in all shapes and sizes, you know.

992
01:17:58,600 --> 01:18:00,750
这个核桃红枣面包太好吃了
This walnut date loaf is exceptional.

993
01:18:00,750 --> 01:18:02,310
-能先停停吗  -怎么了
- Let me just stop you there. - Yeah?

994
01:18:02,350 --> 01:18:06,430
这个基金  是跟钱有关的吗
Is this grant, like, got money involved or whatever? No?

995
01:18:06,430 --> 01:18:06,930
没错
Yeah.

996
01:18:06,930 --> 01:18:08,660
-没错  -资金非常充足
- Yeah. - It's pretty well funded.

997
01:18:09,030 --> 01:18:10,360
也不看看我是谁
Look who you're talking to.

998
01:18:10,960 --> 01:18:12,950
-我能跟他谈五分钟吗  -请便
- Can I have 5 minutes with him? - Sure.

999
01:18:18,880 --> 01:18:21,990
作为核桃红枣面包  这味道还不错了
As walnut date loaves go, that wasn't bad.

1000
01:18:24,210 --> 01:18:26,210
这是什么  复古科技吗
What do we have here, retro tech, huh?

1001
01:18:26,210 --> 01:18:29,290
-二手店  救世军  -捡的垃圾

- You're a dumpster diver. - Yeah, I was...

1003
01:18:31,340 --> 01:18:32,400
随便了  那个
Anyway, look.

1004
01:18:32,990 --> 01:18:34,860
我绝对没申请过你的基金
I definitely did not apply for your grant.

1005
01:18:35,130 --> 01:18:36,350
-我先说  -好吧
- Me first. - Okay.

1006
01:18:36,350 --> 01:18:38,830
有个反问的问题要问你
Quick question of the rhetorical variety.

1007
01:18:40,490 --> 01:18:42,210
这是你吧
That's you, right?

1008
01:18:42,860 --> 01:18:43,690
不是
Um, no.

1009
01:18:43,690 --> 01:18:45,160
-你什么意思  -就是你
- What do you. What do you... - Yeah.

1010
01:18:46,420 --> 01:18:47,720
看你的动作
Look at you go.

1011
01:18:47,890 --> 01:18:51,140
接得漂亮  时速40英里  三千磅的车
Wow, nice catch! 3000 pounds. 40 miles an hour.

1012
01:18:51,390 --> 01:18:54,120
这可不容易  你很厉害啊
It's not easy. You got mad skills.

1013
01:18:54,120 --> 01:18:56,120
这是油管上的吧  对吗
That's all-That's all on Youtube though, right?

1014
01:18:56,130 --> 01:18:57,720
你是在那儿找到的吧
I mean that's where you found it.

1015
01:18:57,820 --> 01:19:00,390
这些可都是假的  是电脑特效
Cause' you know that's all fake. It's all done on a computer?

1016
01:19:01,660 --> 01:19:03,030
就像那个视频一样  什么来着
It's like that video, what is it?

1017
01:19:03,030 --> 01:19:05,720
对对  就像凤凰城上空的飞碟吗
Yeah yeah yeah... you mean like those UFOs over Phoenix?

1018
01:19:05,720 --> 01:19:06,720
没错
Exactly!

1019
01:19:06,760 --> 01:19:07,840
这是什么
What have we here?

1020
01:19:10,690 --> 01:19:12,120
这是...
That's a...

1021
01:19:14,660 --> 01:19:15,390
那么
So.

1022

蜘蛛侠
S... Spider-Man.

1025
01:19:26,140 --> 01:19:27,740
就穿这连体睡衣  还叫侠
Not in that onesie, you're not.

1026
01:19:28,640 --> 01:19:29,960
这不是连体睡衣
It's not a onesie.

1027
01:19:31,830 --> 01:19:32,420
难以置信
I don't believe this.

1028
01:19:32,420 --> 01:19:34,990
我今天其实还真挺顺利的呢  斯塔克先生
I was actually having a real good day today, you know, Mr. Stark.

1029
01:19:35,120 --> 01:19:36,090
没误地铁
Didn't miss my trains.

1030
01:19:36,090 --> 01:19:38,860
毫不费力地捡到一台质量很好的DVD机
This perfectly good DVD player was just sitting there and...

1031
01:19:39,040 --> 01:19:41,630
代数考试也轻松搞定
Algebra test. Nailed it!

1032
01:19:42,500 --> 01:19:44,130
还有谁知道  有人知道吗
Who else knows? Anybody?

1033
01:19:45,590 --> 01:19:46,960
没人了
Nobody.

1034
01:19:47,010 --> 01:19:49,130
连你那位异常迷人的婶婶也不知道吗
Not even your... unusually attractive Aunt?

1035
01:19:49,130 --> 01:19:49,820
不
No.

1036
01:19:50,120 --> 01:19:51,480
不知道
No, no. No, no.

1037
01:19:51,480 --> 01:19:53,220
如果她知道  她会抓狂的
If she knew, she would freak out.

1038
01:19:53,230 --> 01:19:55,040
她抓狂  我就慌乱
And when she freaks out, I freak out.

1039
01:19:55,040 --> 01:19:57,490
知道我觉得什么很厉害吗  这个网

抗拉强度简直爆表
Tensile strength is off the charts.

1041
01:20:01,340 --> 01:20:03,710
-是谁制造的  -我
- Who manufactured them? - I did.

1042
01:20:05,150 --> 01:20:06,310
爬墙
Climbing the walls.

1043
01:20:06,320 --> 01:20:08,370
怎么做到的  粘性手套吗
How are you doing that? Adhesive gloves?

1044
01:20:08,400 --> 01:20:10,090
说来话长  我...
It's a long story. I was uh...

1045
01:20:10,090 --> 01:20:12,400
老天爷  戴这东西还能看见吗
Lordy! Can you even see in these?

1046
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:14,590
-是的  我能看见  -我瞎了
- Yes. Yes, I can! I can. - I'm blind!

1047
01:20:15,780 --> 01:20:19,210
能看见的  好吗  就是...
I can-I can see in those. Okay? It's just that...

1048
01:20:19,220 --> 01:20:20,770
那件事发生之后
when...whatever happened happened,

1049
01:20:20,770 --> 01:20:23,090
我的感官变得超级敏感
it's like my senses have been dialed to 11.

1050
01:20:23,890 --> 01:20:26,320
接收的信息实在太多
There's... There's way too much input, so...

1051
01:20:26,420 --> 01:20:28,160
所以戴那个能帮我集中注意
they... they just kinda help me focus.

1052
01:20:28,170 --> 01:20:30,280
你急需升级装备
You're in dire need of an upgrade.

1053
01:20:30,820 --> 01:20:32,420
从头到脚  系统化地升级
Systemic, top to bottom.

1054
01:20:32,420 --> 01:20:34,390
全部翻新  我就是为此而来
100-point restoration. That's why I'm here.

1055
01:20:37,210 --> 01:20:38,520
你为什么要做这个
Why are you doing this?

1056
01:20:39,820 --> 01:20:40,770
我必须要问问  你的动力是什么
I got to know. What's your M.O.

1057
01:20:40,770 --> 01:20:42,900
是什么激励你早上起床
What gets you out of that twin bed in the morning?

1058
01:20:43,560 --> 01:20:44,750
因为
Because...

1059
01:20:48,910 --> 01:20:50,500
因为我这辈子一直都是平凡的自己
because I've been me my whole life,

1060
01:20:50,920 --> 01:20:52,920
六个月前我得到了这些能力
and I've had these powers for 6 months.

1061
01:20:54,120 --> 01:20:56,240
我读书  搭建电脑
I read books, I build computers...

1062
01:20:57,820 --> 01:21:00,050
还有  我很想去打橄榄球
And-And yeah. I would love to play football.

1063
01:21:00,470 --> 01:21:02,220
但我之前打不了  所以现在又不能去
But I couldn't then so I shouldn't now.

1064
01:21:02,220 --> 01:21:03,970
-是啊  因为你变了  -没错
- Sure. 'Cause you're different. - Exactly.

1065
01:21:03,970 --> 01:21:06,100
但我不能说出去  所以我没说
But I can't tell anybody that, so I'm not.

1066
01:21:10,640 --> 01:21:12,800
如果你有了这份能力
Look, when you can do the things that I can,

1067
01:21:13,950 --> 01:21:15,330
却不作为
but you don't...

1068
01:21:16,820 --> 01:21:18,740
之后发生的坏事
and then the bad things happen,

1069
01:21:20,450 --> 01:21:22,030
就是你的责任
they happen because of you.

1070
01:21:26,790 --> 01:21:29,810
你想帮助小人物  你想尽一份力
So you wanna look out for the little guy. You wanna do your part.

1071
01:21:29,840 --> 01:21:31,500
让这世界更美好什么的  是吗
Make the world a better place all that, right?

1072
01:21:31,500 --> 01:21:34,210
是啊  就是帮助小人物
Yeah. Yeah just looking out... for the little guy.

1073
01:21:35,220 --> 01:21:36,680
就是这样
That's-That's what it is.

1074
01:21:44,290 --> 01:21:46,250
我要坐这儿  腿挪开
I'm going to sit here, so you move the leg.

1075
01:21:55,520 --> 01:21:57,040
-有护照吗  -没有
- You got a passport? - Uh, no.

1076
01:21:57,040 --> 01:21:58,270
我连驾照都没有
I don't.. don't even have a driving license.

1077
01:21:58,270 --> 01:21:59,490
去过德国吗
You ever been to Germany?

1078
01:21:59,490 --> 01:22:00,760
-没有  -你会喜欢那里的
- No. - Oh, you'll love it.

1079
01:22:00,760 --> 01:22:02,870
-我不能去德国  -为什么
- I can't go to Germany! - Why?

1080
01:22:05,290 --> 01:22:07,150
我还有作业呢
I got... homework.

1081
01:22:07,320 --> 01:22:08,770
好吧  我会当你没说那话
Alright, I'm gonna pretend you didn't say that.

1082
01:22:08,770 --> 01:22:11,460
不  我认真的  我不能就辍学
No. I'm-I'm being serious! I can't just drop out of school!

1083
01:22:11,460 --> 01:22:12,500
可能会有点危险
Might be a little dangerous.

1084
01:22:12,500 --> 01:22:15,270
最好跟漂亮婶婶说一声我要带你出去
Better tell Aunt Hottie I'm taking you on a field trip.

1085
01:22:17,300 --> 01:22:18,850
别告诉梅婶婶
Don't tell Aunt May.

1086
01:22:19,940 --> 01:22:21,580
好吧  蜘蛛侠
Alright, Spider-Man.

1087
01:22:24,770 --> 01:22:27,580
-给我解开  -抱歉  我这就弄
- Get me out of this. - I'm sorry, I'll get that.

1088
01:22:40,220 --> 01:22:42,870
-怎么回事  -请待在这里
- What is it? - Stay here, please.

1089
01:22:49,780 --> 01:22:52,650
-看来我该敲门的  -天呐
- Guess I should have knocked. - Oh my god.

1090
01:22:53,370 --> 01:22:56,360
-你来做什么  -放孩子的鸽子
- What are you doing here? - Disappointing my kids.

1091
01:23:00,770 --> 01:23:02,300
我本该带他们去滑水的
I'm suppose to go water skiing.

1092
01:23:03,010 --> 01:23:04,600
但是队长需要我们帮忙  走吧
But Cap needs our help, come on.

1093
01:23:05,130 --> 01:23:06,240
克林特
Clint!

1094
01:23:07,660 --> 01:23:09,250
你不该来的
You should not be here.

1095
01:23:11,550 --> 01:23:12,700
是吗
Really?

1096
01:23:13,230 --> 01:23:16,410
我才退休了5分钟  世界就乱套了
I retired for, what, like 5 minutes? And it all goes to shit.

1097
01:23:16,420 --> 01:23:18,940
请考虑一下你行为的后果
Please consider the consequences of your actions.

1098
01:23:18,950 --> 01:23:20,270
考虑过了
Okay, they're considered.

1099
01:23:21,500 --> 01:23:22,910
好了  我们得走了
Okay, we got to go.

1100
01:23:27,650 --> 01:23:28,960
是这边
It's this way.

1101
01:23:29,120 --> 01:23:30,980
我闯的祸够多了
I've caused enough problems.

1102
01:23:35,510 --> 01:23:36,870
你得帮帮忙  旺达
You got to help me, Wanda.

1103
01:23:37,030 --> 01:23:38,810
你要闷闷不乐不如去上高中
Look you want to mope you can go to high school.

1104
01:23:38,810 --> 01:23:41,660
你想弥补  就给我行动起来
You want to make amends. You get off your ass.

1105
01:23:42,410 --> 01:23:43,590
该死
Shit.

1106
01:23:49,730 --> 01:23:51,620
就知道我该先活动下筋骨的
I know I should have stretched.

1107
01:24:05,170 --> 01:24:09,030
-克林特  你打不过我  -我知道
- Clint, you can't overpower me. - I know I can't.

1108
01:24:10,130 --> 01:24:11,320
但她能
But, she can.

1109
01:24:13,180 --> 01:24:16,360
幻视  够了  放了他
Vision. That's enough, let him go.

1110
01:24:17,270 --> 01:24:19,610
-我要走了  -我不能让你走
- I'm leaving. - I can't let you.

1111
01:24:24,540 --> 01:24:26,150
对不起
I'm sorry.

1112
01:24:29,440 --> 01:24:31,070
如果你这么做
If you do this,

1113
01:24:31,610 --> 01:24:34,510
世人会永远害怕你
they will never stop being afraid of you.

1114
01:24:35,920 --> 01:24:39,450
他们的恐惧我控制不了  但我的可以
I can't control their fear, only my own.

1115
01:24:54,840 --> 01:24:57,400
走吧  还有一站呢
Come on. We got one more stop.

1116
01:24:58,200 --> 01:24:59,680
早晚会找到的
It's just a matter of time.

1117
01:24:59,800 --> 01:25:01,750
我们的卫星在进行面部识别
Our satellites are running facial,

1118
01:25:01,750 --> 01:25:04,690
生物识别和行为模式扫描
biometric and behavioral pattern scans.

1119
01:25:08,730 --> 01:25:11,380
闪开  别逼我动手
Move, or you will be moved.

1120
01:25:12,420 --> 01:25:14,990
虽然那会很有看头
As entertaining as that would be.

1121
01:25:15,350 --> 01:25:17,100
你真觉得你能找到他吗
You really think you can find him?

1122
01:25:17,960 --> 01:25:19,790
我的资源很可观
My resources are considerable.

1123
01:25:19,800 --> 01:25:22,170
是啊  世界花了70年时间才找到巴恩斯
Yeah, it took the world 70 years to find Barnes...

1124
01:25:22,170 --> 01:25:24,770
你大概花一半时间就能做到了
So, you could probably do that in about half the time.

1125
01:25:25,950 --> 01:25:27,300
你知道他们在哪
You know where they are.

1126
01:25:27,730 --> 01:25:29,340
我认识一个知道的人
I know someone who does.

1127
01:25:32,360 --> 01:25:35,150
你恐怕不太明白什么叫逃跑车吧
I'm not sure you understand the concept of a get-away car.

1128
01:25:35,330 --> 01:25:36,690
这车低调
It's low profile.

1129
01:25:36,870 --> 01:25:39,490
很好  这些东西可是很招眼
Good, 'cause this stuff tends to draw a crowd.

1130
01:25:41,470 --> 01:25:44,120
-你能把座椅往前点吗  -不能
- Can you move your seat up? - No.

1131
01:25:44,570 --> 01:25:45,880
我又欠你个人情
I owe you again.

1132
01:25:46,260 --> 01:25:47,480
我记着呢
Keeping a list.

1133
01:25:50,880 --> 01:25:52,780
他之前可企图杀我呢
You know, he kind of tried to kill me.

1134
01:25:53,590 --> 01:25:56,180
抱歉  那个我也会记着的
Sorry, I'll put it on the list, too.

1135
01:25:59,590 --> 01:26:01,070
他们会来找你的
They're gonna come looking for you.

1136
01:26:02,270 --> 01:26:03,180
我知道
I know.

1137
01:26:05,750 --> 01:26:07,090
谢谢你  莎伦
Thank you, Sharon.

1138
01:26:22,760 --> 01:26:24,820
-这真是  -早该了
- That was... - Late.

1139
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:26,150
可不是
Damn right.

1140
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:32,160
-我该走了  -好
- I should go. - Okay.

1141
01:26:57,100 --> 01:26:58,060
队长
Cap.

1142
01:26:58,790 --> 01:27:00,440
你知道我不是别无选择也不会找你
You know I wouldn't have called If I had any other choice.

1143
01:27:00,440 --> 01:27:02,110
你是帮我忙呢
Hey man, you're doing me a favour.

1144
01:27:02,110 --> 01:27:04,640
再说  我还要还债
Besides... I owed a debt.

1145
01:27:04,720 --> 01:27:08,360
-多谢支持我  -我该行动起来了
- Thanks for having my back. - It was time to get off my ass.

1146
01:27:08,650 --> 01:27:10,190
另一个新人呢
How about our other recruit.

1147
01:27:10,370 --> 01:27:11,580
他迫不及待呢
He's raring to go.

1148
01:27:12,660 --> 01:27:14,530
我给了他点咖啡
Had to put a little coffee in him... but

1149
01:27:15,410 --> 01:27:16,470
他应该没问题
he should be good.

1150
01:27:19,560 --> 01:27:21,430
这是哪个时区
What timezone is this?

1151
01:27:21,540 --> 01:27:23,300
去吧  去吧
Come on. Come on.

1152
01:27:26,290 --> 01:27:28,380
-美国队长  -朗先生

1153
01:27:29,600 --> 01:27:32,510
真是荣幸  我握得太久了
It's an honor. I'm shaking your hand too long.

1154

这太赞了  美国队长啊
This is awesome. Captain America.

1155

你我也认识  你好棒
I know you too, you're great.

1156
01:27:40,440 --> 01:27:41,530
天呐
Jeez.

1157
01:27:42,180 --> 01:27:43,370
我想说
Look, I wanted to say.

1158
01:27:43,410 --> 01:27:45,770
我知道你认识很多厉害人物
I know you know a lot of super people, so...

1159
01:27:46,610 --> 01:27:48,190
多谢想到我
Thanks for thinking of me.

1160
01:27:48,540 --> 01:27:50,830
-伙计  -好啊  小豆子
- Hey, man. - What's up tic-tac.

1161
01:27:51,030 --> 01:27:53,100
见到你很高兴  那个...上次的事
Good to see you. Look. Look, what happened last time when I...

1162
01:27:53,100 --> 01:27:56,760
是场很棒的面试  但绝不会再有下次了
It was a great audition, but it'll... it'll never happen again.

1163
01:27:56,770 --> 01:27:58,210
他们告诉你我们要对付什么了吗
They tell you what we're up against?

1164
01:27:59,050 --> 01:28:02,180
好像是几个疯子刺客
Something about some... psycho assassins.

1165
01:28:02,590 --> 01:28:04,590
这次我们的行动不合法
We're outside the law on this one.

1166
01:28:04,810 --> 01:28:06,860
如果你跟我们来  就是通缉犯了
So, if you come with us, you're a wanted man.

1167
01:28:07,370 --> 01:28:08,770
早习惯了
Yeah, well, what else is new?

1168
01:28:08,770 --> 01:28:11,630
-我们该走了  -有架直升机等着我们呢

01:28:13,850 --> 01:28:16,700
请所有乘客撤离机场
Alle Passagiere müssen im Flughafen sofort evakuieren.

1171
01:28:16,720 --> 01:28:18,540
他们在疏散机场
They're evacuating the airport.

1172
01:28:18,540 --> 01:28:20,570

换装
Suit up.

1174
01:28:44,420 --> 01:28:46,120
在机场总能碰到熟人  真是怪啊
It's so weird how you run into people at the airport.

1175
01:28:46,120 --> 01:28:48,060
-你说是不是  -非常怪
- Don't you think that's weird? - Definitely weird.

1176
01:28:48,060 --> 01:28:49,330
听我说  托尼
Hear me out, Tony.

1177
01:28:49,330 --> 01:28:52,720
那个精神病医生  他才是幕后黑手
That doctor, the psychiatrist, he's behind all of this.

1178
01:28:56,050 --> 01:28:58,430
-队长  -陛下
- Captain. - Your Highness.

1179
01:28:58,840 --> 01:28:59,910
总之
Anyway.

1180

1181
01:29:02,380 --> 01:29:04,000
已经过了24小时了
That was 24 hours ago.

1182
01:29:04,210 --> 01:29:06,620
-帮兄弟一把啊  -你抓错人了
- Can you help a brother out? - You're after the wrong guy.

1183
01:29:06,620 --> 01:29:08,570
你的判断力有问题
Your judgment is askew.

1184
01:29:09,590 --> 01:29:11,240
你的老战友昨天杀了很多无辜者

1185
01:29:11,240 --> 01:29:13,820
还有五个跟他一样的超级战士
And there are 5 more super soldiers just like him.

1186
01:29:14,700 --> 01:29:17,000
我不能让那个医生先找到他们  托尼
I can't let the doctor find them first, Tony. I can't.

1187
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:18,040
史蒂夫
Steve.

1188
01:29:18,980 --> 01:29:21,570
你知道接下来会怎么样
You know, what's about to happen.

1189
01:29:21,630 --> 01:29:24,160
你这次也要打出一条血路吗
Do you really want to punch your way out of this one?

1190
01:29:28,060 --> 01:29:30,160
好吧  我没耐心了
All right, I've run out of patience.

1191
01:29:30,160 --> 01:29:31,420
内衣宝宝
Underoos!

1192
01:29:36,570 --> 01:29:37,700
干得好  孩子

1193
01:29:38,280 --> 01:29:40,310
谢谢  落地不太理想
Thanks. Well, I could've stuck the landing a little better.

1194
01:29:40,310 --> 01:29:41,480
新服装...不太适应
It's... just the new suit...

1195
01:29:41,480 --> 01:29:42,750
等等  这不是事儿  斯塔克先生
Wait, it's nothing, Mr. Stark.

1196
01:29:42,750 --> 01:29:43,880
服装很完美  谢谢您
It's-It's perfect, thank you.

1197
01:29:43,880 --> 01:29:45,670
嗯  我们不用开始闲扯的
Yeah, we don't really need to start a conversation.

1198
01:29:45,670 --> 01:29:47,710
好吧  队长
Okay. Cap... Captain.

1199
01:29:48,580 --> 01:29:49,670
我是蜘蛛侠  你的大粉丝
Big fan, I'm Spider-Man.

1200
01:29:49,670 --> 01:29:51,530

1201
01:29:51,530 --> 01:29:53,030

A safe place. I'm trying to keep....

1206
01:30:04,100 --> 01:30:06,730
我在努力阻止你分裂复仇者联盟
I'm trying to keep you from tearing the Avengers apart.

1207
01:30:07,540 --> 01:30:09,050
你签字时就已经分裂我们了
You did that when you signed.

1208
01:30:10,990 --> 01:30:11,950
好吧  行了
Alright, we're done.

1209

交出巴恩斯  跟我们走
You're gonna turn Barnes over and you're gonna come with us,

1210
01:30:14,850 --> 01:30:16,860
马上照做  否则
now, because it's us

1211
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:18,140
一支联合特别行动司令部的分队

1212
01:30:18,140 --> 01:30:20,740
就会出动  他们下手不会留情的

1213
01:30:23,130 --> 01:30:24,220

Come on.

1214
01:30:25,500 --> 01:30:26,460
我们找到了

Rhodey, you want to take Cap?

1223
01:30:48,190 --> 01:30:50,430
候机大厅有俩  威尔逊和巴恩斯
Got two in the terminal. Wilson and Barnes.

1224
01:30:50,430 --> 01:30:51,700
巴恩斯是我的
Barnes is mine!

1225
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:54,240
斯塔克先生  我该做什么
Hey, Mr. Stark, what should I do?

1226
01:30:54,240 --> 01:30:56,220
不是说好了吗  别靠太近  用网缠住他们
What we discussed. Keep your distance. Web them up.

1227
01:30:56,220 --> 01:30:57,430
好的  收到
Okay, copy that!

1228
01:31:02,460 --> 01:31:03,580
让开  队长
Move, Captain.

1229
01:31:04,110 --> 01:31:06,130
我不会说第二遍
I won't ask a second time.

1230
01:31:08,230 --> 01:31:10,090
听着  我真的不想伤害你
Look, I really don't want to hurt you.

1231
01:31:10,260 --> 01:31:11,880
不必担心
I wouldn't stress about it.

1232
01:31:23,820 --> 01:31:27,430
-那是什么鬼  -这年头谁都有点花招
- What the hell was that? - Everyone's got a gimmick now.

1233
01:31:34,180 --> 01:31:37,270
你有金属臂  太牛逼了  哥们
You have a metal arm? That is awesome, dude!

1234
01:31:38,590 --> 01:31:40,740
你有权保持沉默
You have the right to remain silent!

1235
01:31:55,020 --> 01:31:56,310
对不住了  队长  虽然不致命
Sorry, Cap. This won't kill you

1236
01:31:56,310 --> 01:31:58,020
但还是会挺疼的
but it ain't gonna tickle either.

1237
01:32:03,150 --> 01:32:05,160
旺达  我觉得你伤了幻视的心
Wanda, I think you hurt Vision's feelings.

1238
01:32:05,160 --> 01:32:06,550
你把我关在房间里
You locked me in my room.

1239
01:32:06,550 --> 01:32:08,200
好吧  首先  这说法太夸张了
Okay. First, that's an exaggeration.

1240
01:32:08,200 --> 01:32:10,360
其次  我是为了保护你
Second, I did it to protect you.

1241
01:32:10,630 --> 01:32:12,060
-克林特  -伙计
- Hey, Clint. - Hey, man.

1242
01:32:12,060 --> 01:32:15,520
看来退休生活不适合你  高尔夫打烦了吗
Clearly retirement doesn't suit you. You got tired of shooting golf?

1243
01:32:15,700 --> 01:32:18,130
我玩18杆  杆杆进洞
Well, I played 18, shot 18.

1244
01:32:19,170 --> 01:32:20,780
就是射不偏
Just can't seem to miss.

1245
01:32:22,830 --> 01:32:25,550
-凡事总有第一次啊  -让你转头了
- First time for everything. - Made you look.

1246
01:32:35,950 --> 01:32:37,870
检测到多处挫伤
Multiple contusions detected.

1247
01:32:37,870 --> 01:32:39,700
嗯  我也感觉到了
Yeah, I detected that too.

1248
01:32:47,180 --> 01:32:48,140
天啊
Oh, god.

1249
01:32:49,550 --> 01:32:51,610
伙计  这是你丢的吧
Hey, buddy, I think you lost this!

1250
01:33:03,050 --> 01:33:04,570
这翅膀是碳化纤维的
Those wings carbon fiber?

1251
01:33:04,570 --> 01:33:05,880
这玩意是你射出来的
Is this stuff coming out of you?

1252
01:33:05,880 --> 01:33:08,060
如果是  这刚柔度就难怪了
That would explain the rigidity flexibility ratio.

1253
01:33:08,060 --> 01:33:09,580
我得说  真是牛逼
which, gotta say, that's awesome man.

1254
01:33:09,580 --> 01:33:11,160
不知道你参没参加过战斗
I don't know if you've been a fight before

1255
01:33:11,160 --> 01:33:12,840
但我们一般没这么多废话
but there's usually not this much talking.

1256
01:33:12,840 --> 01:33:14,390
好吧  不好意思  我的错
Alright, sorry, my bad.

1257
01:33:19,260 --> 01:33:20,690
两位  我也想继续和你们打
Guys, look. I'd love to keep this up

1258
01:33:20,700 --> 01:33:22,150
但我今天只有一项任务
but I've only got one job here today

1259
01:33:22,150 --> 01:33:23,560
我得给斯塔克先生留个好印象
and I gotta impress Mr. Stark,

1260
01:33:23,560 --> 01:33:26,200
真抱歉了  什么
so, I'm really sorry. What?

1261
01:33:29,210 --> 01:33:30,910
你就不能早点那么做吗
You couldn't have done that earlier?

1262
01:33:31,940 --> 01:33:33,190
讨厌
I hate you.

1263
01:33:39,750 --> 01:33:40,620
这可好
Great?

1264
01:33:40,620 --> 01:33:41,830
队长  接着
Cap, heads up!

1265
01:33:43,830 --> 01:33:45,450
朝这玩意扔
Throw it at this.

1266
01:33:45,610 --> 01:33:46,600
扔
Now!

1267
01:33:50,390 --> 01:33:51,530
不是吧
Oh, come on!

1268
01:33:54,780 --> 01:33:57,420
天呐  我以为是辆水车
Oh, man. I thought it was a water truck.

1269
01:33:58,270 --> 01:33:59,210
抱歉
Sorry.

1270
01:34:01,610 --> 01:34:03,260
好吧  我现在被惹毛了
Alright. Now, I'm pissed.

1271
01:34:03,840 --> 01:34:05,260
这是计划的一部分吗
Is this part of the plan?

1272
01:34:05,260 --> 01:34:08,020
我本来计划对他们客气些的  想加大火力吗
Well, my plan was go easy on them. You want to switch it up?

1273
01:34:10,850 --> 01:34:12,160
那是我们的飞机
There's our ride.

1274
01:34:13,970 --> 01:34:14,830
跟上
Come on!

1275
01:34:23,950 --> 01:34:25,390
罗杰斯队长
Captain Rogers.

1276
01:34:26,130 --> 01:34:29,180
我知道你相信自己是对的
I know you believe what you're doing is right.

1277
01:34:29,840 --> 01:34:33,800
但为了大局  你必须马上投降
But, for the collective good, you must surrender now.

1278
01:34:51,170 --> 01:34:52,650
怎么办  队长
What do we do, Cap?

1279
01:34:53,960 --> 01:34:55,090
打
We fight.

1280
01:34:57,010 --> 01:34:58,490
这下可好
This is gonna end well.

1281
01:35:05,400 --> 01:35:06,890
他们没打算停下来
They're not stopping.

1282
01:35:06,890 --> 01:35:07,970
我们也不会停
Neither are we.

1283
01:35:39,050 --> 01:35:42,020
-我们还是朋友吧  -要看你下手多狠了
- We're still friends, right? - Depends on how hard you hit me.

1284
01:35:50,500 --> 01:35:52,290
你放水了
You were pulling your punches.

1285
01:35:56,750 --> 01:35:59,770
-我没杀你父亲  -那你跑什么
- I didn't kill your father. - Then why did you run?

1286
01:36:18,130 --> 01:36:19,890
那玩意根本不符合物理定律啊
That thing does not obey the laws of physics at all.

1287
01:36:19,890 --> 01:36:22,080
孩子  这里有很多你不懂的事
Look kid. There's a lot going on here that you don't understand.

1288
01:36:22,080 --> 01:36:23,730
斯塔克先生说过你会这么说
Mr. Stark said you'd say that.

1289
01:36:33,550 --> 01:36:35,610
他还说要攻击你的腿
He also said to go for your legs.

1290
01:36:47,320 --> 01:36:48,790
克林特  能帮我甩掉他吗
Clint, can you get him off me?

1291
01:36:49,210 --> 01:36:51,840
-抓紧了吗  -抓紧了
- Buckled in? - Yeah. No, I'm good.

1292
01:36:51,840 --> 01:36:54,100
抓紧了  弓箭哥  来吧
I'm good, arrow-guy. Let's go. Let's go!

1293
01:37:15,650 --> 01:37:17,110
斯塔克还跟你说别的了吗
Stark tell you anything else?

1294
01:37:17,110 --> 01:37:19,570
你错了  你觉得你没错
That you're wrong. You think you're right.

1295
01:37:20,600 --> 01:37:21,910
所以你很危险
That makes you dangerous.

1296
01:37:27,210 --> 01:37:28,490
他说得也没错
Guess he had a point.

1297
01:37:33,330 --> 01:37:35,810
你挺有勇气  孩子  你哪来的
You got heart, kid. Where're you from?

1298
01:37:36,530 --> 01:37:37,620
皇后区
Queens.

1299
01:37:38,980 --> 01:37:39,990
我布鲁克林的
Brooklyn.

1300
01:37:46,390 --> 01:37:48,560
-星期五  -部分武器系统离线
- F.R.I.D.A.Y.? - We have some weapon systems offline.

1301
01:37:48,560 --> 01:37:49,470
什么
Hey, what?

1302
01:37:49,560 --> 01:37:52,260
估计得返厂维修了
Oh, you.. you're gonna have to take this into the shop.

1303
01:37:52,260 --> 01:37:55,590
-谁在说话  -你的良心
- Who's speaking? - It's your conscience.

1304
01:37:55,590 --> 01:37:57,570
我们最近都没怎么交流
We don't talk a lot these days.

1305
01:37:57,570 --> 01:38:00,120
-星期五 -启动灭火系统
- F.R.I.D.A.Y.? - Deploying fire suppression system.

1306
01:38:04,360 --> 01:38:05,360
天啊
Oh, boy.

1307
01:38:14,520 --> 01:38:16,770
我们得走了  那家伙现在都该到西伯利亚了
We got to go. That guy's probably in Siberia by now.

1308
01:38:16,770 --> 01:38:18,400
得把会飞的引开
We gotta draw out the fliers.

1309
01:38:18,420 --> 01:38:20,210
我应付幻视  你去飞机那儿
I'll take Vision. You get to the jet.

1310
01:38:20,210 --> 01:38:23,100
不  你们去上飞机  你俩都去
No, you get to the jet! Both of you!

1311
01:38:25,260 --> 01:38:26,740
我们其他人走不了了
The rest of us aren't getting out of here.

1312
01:38:26,740 --> 01:38:29,570
虽然我不想承认  如果我们想打赢
As much as I hate to admit it, if we're gonna win this one,

1313
01:38:29,570 --> 01:38:31,170
有些人就得输
some of us might have to lose it.

1314
01:38:31,410 --> 01:38:33,390
这不是真正重要的战斗  史蒂夫
This isn't the real fight, Steve.

1315
01:38:33,760 --> 01:38:35,330
好吧  山姆  什么计划
Alright, Sam, what's the plan?

1316
01:38:35,330 --> 01:38:37,820
我们得搞个大动静来转移注意力
We need a diversion, something big.

1317
01:38:39,430 --> 01:38:42,740
我有个大家伙  但坚持不了多久
I got something kind of big, but I can't hold it very long.

1318
01:38:42,740 --> 01:38:44,950
等我信号  拼命跑
On my signal, run like hell.

1319
01:38:44,950 --> 01:38:47,790
如果我把自己扯成了两半  也别回来救我
And if I tear myself in half, don't come back for me.

1320
01:38:47,790 --> 01:38:48,940
他要把自己扯成两半了
He's gonna tear himself in half?

1321
01:38:48,940 --> 01:38:50,160
你没问题吗  斯科特
You sure about this, Scott?

1322
01:38:50,160 --> 01:38:52,680
我经常这样做  其实就那么一次
I do it all the time. I mean once...

1323
01:38:52,950 --> 01:38:55,210
在实验室里  然后我晕过去了
...in a lab. Then I passed out.

1324
01:38:55,600 --> 01:38:57,460
我最拽  我最拽  我最拽
I'm the boss. I'm the boss. I'm the boss.

1325
01:38:58,040 --> 01:38:59,270
我最拽
I'm the boss.

1326
01:39:13,770 --> 01:39:15,550
我勒个去
Holy shit!

1327
01:39:19,240 --> 01:39:21,810
那个小不点变大了  他变大了
Okay, tiny dude is big now. He's big now.

1328
01:39:23,500 --> 01:39:24,800
这大概就是信号了
I guess that's the signal.

1329
01:39:24,800 --> 01:39:26,480
厉害  小豆子
Way to go, tic-tac!

1330
01:39:27,930 --> 01:39:29,920
把我的罗德还我
Give me back my Rhodey.

1331
01:39:33,090 --> 01:39:34,200
我去接他
I got him!

1332
01:39:56,690 --> 01:39:59,310
好了  我们这边还有谁隐藏了什么惊人
Okay. Anybody on our side hiding any shocking,

1333
01:39:59,310 --> 01:40:01,640
了不起的能力想展现出来吗
and fantastic abilities they'd like to disclose,

1334
01:40:01,640 --> 01:40:03,440
我愿意接受建议
I'm open to suggestions.

1335
01:40:10,700 --> 01:40:14,340
你想抓他们  先过我这关
You want to get to them? You got to go through me.

1336
01:40:40,750 --> 01:40:42,090
我们还不认识
We haven't met yet.

1337
01:40:45,120 --> 01:40:47,080
-我是克林特  -我不在乎
- I'm Clint. - I don't care.

1338
01:41:14,800 --> 01:41:15,800
下去
Get off.

1339
01:41:30,240 --> 01:41:32,330
有什么东西飞进我身体里了
Something just flew in me!

1340
01:41:56,210 --> 01:41:57,670
你不会停下的  是吗
You're not gonna stop?

1341
01:41:58,070 --> 01:41:59,230
你知道我不能
You know I can't.

1342
01:41:59,890 --> 01:42:01,330
我肯定要后悔的
I'm gonna regret this.

1343
01:42:04,820 --> 01:42:05,760
快走
Go.

1344
01:42:11,490 --> 01:42:14,290
各位  你们看过那部超老的电影吗
Hey, guys. You ever see that really old movie?

1345
01:42:14,370 --> 01:42:15,570
《帝国反击战》
Empire Strikes Back?

1346
01:42:15,570 --> 01:42:17,200
老天  托尼  这家伙多大
Jesus Tony, how old is this guy?

1347
01:42:17,200 --> 01:42:18,420
我不知道  我又没给他碳测年
I don't know, I didn't carbon date him.

1348
01:42:18,420 --> 01:42:19,940
反正挺小的
He's on the young side.

1349
01:42:21,710 --> 01:42:23,020
你知道那一段吗
You know that part?

1350
01:42:23,820 --> 01:42:27,880
就是他们在那个雪星球上  那个会走的机器
When they're on the snow planet? With the walking thingies?

1351
01:42:29,840 --> 01:42:30,990
这孩子的点子可能行得通
Maybe the kid's on to something.

1352
01:42:30,990 --> 01:42:32,500
往上飞  托尼  往上飞
High now, Tony. Go high.

1353
01:42:40,590 --> 01:42:41,580
好诶
Yes!

1354
01:42:42,200 --> 01:42:43,570
太牛逼了
That was awesome!

1355
01:42:58,490 --> 01:43:01,200
有人有橙片吗

What did you do? Get it back up!

Just look.

这才是本该审问巴恩斯的人
Cause that is the fellow who was supposed to interrogate Barnes.

1492
01:54:24,530 --> 01:54:27,090
我显然是错了  山姆  我错了
Clearly, I made a mistake. Sam, I was wrong.

1493
01:54:27,090 --> 01:54:28,390
真是头一遭
That's a first.

队长现在不知要遭遇什么
Cap is definitely off the reservation

他会需要一切的帮助
but he's about to need all the help he can get.

1496
01:54:33,320 --> 01:54:34,710

We don't know each other very well. You don't have to...

行了
It's alright.

1498
01:54:44,980 --> 01:54:46,380
我可以告诉你
Look, I'll tell you.

1499
01:54:46,720 --> 01:54:49,880
但你得作为朋友单独去
But you have to go alone and as a friend.

1500
01:54:51,570 --> 01:54:52,570
当然
Easy.

1501

斯塔克  他说出罗杰斯的下落了吗
Stark, did he give you anything on Rogers?

1502
01:54:58,510 --> 01:54:59,570
没  他叫我下地狱
Nope. Told me to go to hell.

1503
01:54:59,570 --> 01:55:01,820
我还是回基地吧
I'm going back to the compound instead. But,

1504

但你随时可以打给我

Was that the time you used our train money to buy hot dogs?

1510
01:56:22,990 --> 01:56:26,450
你为了替个红发女赢一只玩具熊花了3美元
You blew 3 bucks trying to win that stuffed bear for a redhead.

He can't have been here more than a few hours.

1515
01:56:45,120 --> 01:56:46,790

Long enough to wake them up.

It's been a long day.

或许吧
Maybe.

Ross has no idea I'm here, I'd like to keep it that way.

01:58:04,160 --> 01:58:05,990
否则  我还得逮捕自己
Otherwise, I got to arrest myself.

1526
01:58:07,230 --> 01:58:09,550

对抗策略就绪

1628
02:09:45,560 --> 02:09:46,820
我们好好揍他一顿
Let's kick his ass.

1629
02:10:00,400 --> 02:10:01,470
他是我的朋友
He's my friend.

1630
02:10:02,620 --> 02:10:03,700
我原本也是
So was I.

1631
02:10:10,630 --> 02:10:12,690
不要起来  最后警告
Stay down. Final warning.

1632
02:10:27,080 --> 02:10:28,440
我可以和你耗一整天
I could do this all day.

1633
02:11:35,570 --> 02:11:37,000
那块盾牌不属于你
That shield doesn't belong to you.

1634
02:11:39,470 --> 02:11:43,040
你配不上它  那是我父亲制造的
You don't deserve it! My father made that shield!

1635
02:12:19,140 --> 02:12:20,740
早上八点  晚上五点吃饭
Meals at eight and five.

1636

每天可以去两次厕所

1637
02:12:25,050 --> 02:12:27,260
大声说话  电你
Raise your voice, zap.

1638
02:12:27,980 --> 02:12:30,130
碰玻璃  电你
Touch the glass, zap.

1639
02:12:30,230 --> 02:12:32,270
敢做出格的事  我会收拾你
You step out of line, you deal with me.

1640
02:12:32,270 --> 02:12:34,540
拜托你试试看吧
Please, step out of line.

1641
02:12:36,800 --> 02:12:37,970
感觉怎么样
So, how does it feel?

1642
02:12:39,020 --> 02:12:41,270
花了那么多时间  费了那么多事
Spend all that time, all that effort.

1643
02:12:42,340 --> 02:12:43,080
结果
Then...

1644
02:12:44,360 --> 02:12:45,790
失败得
...to see it fail,

1645
02:12:46,780 --> 02:12:48,280
一塌糊涂
so spectacularly.

1646
02:12:52,620 --> 02:12:53,490
失败了吗
Did it?

1647
02:13:20,170 --> 02:13:21,520
-这只是首次测试  -嗯
- It's just the first pass. - Yeah.

1648
02:13:21,520 --> 02:13:23,710
给我反馈  想到什么都行
Give me some feedback. Anything you think of.

1649
02:13:23,710 --> 02:13:26,470
减震  横向移动
Shock absorption. Lateral movement.

1650
02:13:27,330 --> 02:13:28,240
杯架
Cup holder?

1651
02:13:28,240 --> 02:13:30,450
或许该考虑在下面安空调
You may wanna think about some AC down in...

1652
02:13:33,930 --> 02:13:34,880
好了  我拉你
Let's go. I'll give you a hand.

1653
02:13:34,880 --> 02:13:36,660
不不  别帮我  别帮我
No, no, don't. Don't help. Don't help me.

1654
02:13:52,860 --> 02:13:57,010
138次  138次战斗任务
138. 138 combat missions.

1655
02:13:57,540 --> 02:13:59,370
我飞过138次战斗任务  托尼
That's how many I've flown, Tony.

1656
02:13:59,680 --> 02:14:02,610
每次都可能有去无回  但我还是去了
Every one of them could've been my last, but I flew them.

1657
02:14:04,820 --> 02:14:06,570
因为那是必须打的仗
Cause the fight needed to be fought.

1658
02:14:06,990 --> 02:14:08,800
《协议》的事也是一样
It's the same with these Accords.

1659
02:14:09,040 --> 02:14:12,140
我签字是因为那是正确的做法
I signed because it was the right thing to do.

1660
02:14:14,430 --> 02:14:16,610
这事的确太糟心了
And yeah, this sucks. This is, uh...

1661
02:14:17,900 --> 02:14:19,230
很不走运
This is a bad beat.

1662
02:14:21,780 --> 02:14:23,530
但这没改变我的想法
But it hasn't change my mind.

1663
02:14:24,860 --> 02:14:25,850
我觉得没有
I don't think?

1664
02:14:36,930 --> 02:14:38,650
-你没事吧  -嗯
- You okay? - Oh, yeah.

1665
02:14:41,540 --> 02:14:44,180
你是托尼·"屎塔克"吗
Are you Tony "Stank"?

1666
02:14:44,550 --> 02:14:47,250
是的  他就是托尼·"屎塔克"
Yes, this is-this is Tony "Stank"!

1667
02:14:47,410 --> 02:14:48,880
你来对地方了
You're in the right place.

1668
02:14:48,880 --> 02:14:50,350
多谢了
Thank you for that!

1669
02:14:50,910 --> 02:14:52,830
-这梗我要用一辈子  -天呐
- Never dropping that, by the way. - Oh, my god.

1670
02:14:52,830 --> 02:14:56,470
一人桌  "屎塔克"先生  坐在厕所边吧
Table for one, Mr. "Stank". Please, by the bathroom.

托尼
Tony.

1673
02:15:05,020 --> 02:15:06,690
我很高兴你回到了基地
I'm glad you're back at the compound.

1674
02:15:06,920 --> 02:15:10,020
我不希望你一个人在豪宅里晃
I don't like the idea of you rattling around a mansion by yourself.

1675
02:15:10,390 --> 02:15:11,530
我们都需要家人
We all need family.

1676
02:15:13,100 --> 02:15:16,480
复仇者联盟属于你  或许多于属于我
The Avengers are yours, maybe more so than mine.

1677
02:15:17,700 --> 02:15:19,970
我从18岁开始就是一个人
I've been on my own since I was 18.

1678
02:15:21,010 --> 02:15:25,180
我从未真正融入哪里  哪怕是在军队
I never really fit in anywhere, even in the army.

1679
02:15:27,170 --> 02:15:31,620
我想我信任  人  个体
My faith's in... people, I guess. Individuals.

1680
02:15:32,550 --> 02:15:35,310
很高兴  大部分时候
And, I'm happy to say that for the most part,

1681
02:15:35,920 --> 02:15:37,210
他们没让我失望
they haven't let me down.

1682
02:15:39,640 --> 02:15:41,810
所以我也不能辜负他们
Which is why I can't let them down either.

1683
02:15:46,030 --> 02:15:49,070
锁可以换  但或许不该换
Locks can be replaced, but, maybe they shouldn't.

1684
02:15:51,350 --> 02:15:52,740
我知道我伤了你  托尼
I know I hurt you, Tony.

1685
02:15:53,640 --> 02:15:54,820
我大概是觉得
I guessed I thought

1686
02:15:54,890 --> 02:15:58,480
不告诉你你父母的事  是照顾你的感情
by not telling you about your parents, I was sparing you. But...

1687
02:15:59,340 --> 02:16:01,670
但我现在明白  我只是顾及自己
I can see now that I was really sparing myself.

1688
02:16:02,420 --> 02:16:03,350
对不起
And I'm sorry.

1689
02:16:04,560 --> 02:16:06,380
希望你有天能理解
Hopefully one day you can understand.

1690
02:16:07,570 --> 02:16:09,320
我也希望我们能在《协议》的事上达成一致
I wish we agree on the Accords,

1691
02:16:09,320 --> 02:16:10,190
真的
I really do.

1692
02:16:11,160 --> 02:16:12,560
我知道你只是在做你相信的事
I know you're doing what you believe in.

1693
02:16:12,560 --> 02:16:15,740
而我们也都只能做到这点  我们也该这么做
And that's all any of us can do. That's all any of us should.

嗯  接过来
Yeah, put him through.

1697
02:16:24,780 --> 02:16:26,570
-托尼  我们有麻烦了  -请待机
- Tony, we have a problem. - Ah, please hold.

1698
02:16:26,570 --> 02:16:28,370
不  别
No. Don't...

1699
02:16:30,800 --> 02:16:31,930
所以  不管怎样
So, no matter what.

1700
02:16:33,410 --> 02:16:34,330
我保证
I promise you,

1701
02:16:34,660 --> 02:16:35,690
如果你需要我们
if you need us,

1702
02:16:37,060 --> 02:16:38,090
如果你需要我
if you need me,

1703
02:16:43,710 --> 02:16:44,630
我会去的
I'll be there.

你确定吗
You sure about this?

1709
02:18:47,350 --> 02:18:49,190
我不能信任自己的大脑
I can't trust my own mind.

1710
02:18:52,010 --> 02:18:54,630
直到他们想到办法把洗脑的东西清理掉
So, until they figure out how to get this stuff out of my head

1711
02:18:54,630 --> 02:18:56,900
我想继续沉睡是最好的选择
I think going back under is the best thing,

龅牙那个

1727
02:26:40,340 --> 02:26:42,570
不不不  你不认识他  他布鲁克林的
No, no, no. You don't know him, he's from Brooklyn.
